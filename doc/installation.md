## Installation: Plugin

1. Enable custom scripts in Firebot (Settings > **Scripts**) if you have not already done so.
2. From the latest [Release](https://github.com/TheStaticMage/firebot-combo-event/releases), download `firebot-combo-event-<version>.js` into your Firebot scripts directory (File > Open Data Folder, then select the "scripts" directory).
3. Go to Settings > **Scripts** > **Manage Startup Scripts** > **Add New Script** and add the `firebot-combo-event-<version>.js` script.
4. Restart Firebot. (The plugin will _not_ be loaded until you actually restart Firebot.)
